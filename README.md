Welcome to reactnative_starterapp project
=====

This is my personal test project for starter app in react native with facebook login/register, native login/register, user profile and airbnb map. This project is my first touch with react native.

### Getting Started:

Firstly, you must have installed react-native on your machine. 
You will need Xcode, node.js, the React Native command line tools, and Watchman:

```gradle
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.
```gradle
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Then you're able to run projects so now you can init your own project via:
```gradle
react-native init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-ios
```

Here's come's a magic and now clone my source code into yours using git clone... and do not forget to use ma package.json and install all nodes.
